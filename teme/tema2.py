#1. Define a function which receives a string as a parameter. The function splits the string into pairs of two characters.
# If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').
#Examples:
#solution('abc') # should return ['ab', 'c_']
#solution('abcdef') # should return ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']




#2. Create a function function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.
#Examples
#"This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"
#"double  spaces"      ==> "elbuod  secaps"





#3. According to the creation myths of the Abrahamic religions, Adam and Eve were the first Humans to wander the Earth.
#You have to do God's job. The creation method must return an array of length 2 containing objects (representing Adam and Eve).
# The first object in the array should be an instance of the class Man. The second should be an instance of the class Woman.
# Both objects have to be subclasses of Human. Your job is to implement the Human, Man and Woman classes, then to define the creation function as stated above.
